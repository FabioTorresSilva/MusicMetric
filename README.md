# MusicMetric - ReactApp

MusicMetric is a web application designed to provide personalized insights into your Spotify listening habits. MusicMetric uses Spotify data in JSON format, allows you to view detailed metrics about your favorite artists, most played songs and more!!

## Introduction

This project was born from the need to explore and analyze one's own listening data more deeply than what Spotify natively offers. With MusicMetric, users can gain detailed insights into their musical preferences and listening patterns over time.

## What We Learned

- **Data Processing and Visualization**: Learning how to process and visualize complex datasets in a user-friendly manner. This included parsing JSON data, aggregating statistics, and presenting them in an engaging and informative way.

- **UI/UX Design Principles**: Enhancing our skills in UI/UX design by focusing on the user journey, making the application not only functional but also intuitive and aesthetically pleasing, we made everything from scratch.

- **Project Management**: Improving project management and planning skills, learning to break down the project into manageable pieces, and prioritizing tasks effectively.

- **Teamwork and Communication**: Working as part of a team has been one of the most valuable aspects of this project. We learned the importance of clear communication, mutual respect, and the power of diverse ideas.
